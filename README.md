**🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation**


This project applies Machine Learning and Data Visualization techniques to segment mall customers based on their behavior and demographics. The goal is to help businesses understand customer patterns and target marketing strategies effectively.

**📁 Project Structure**

i) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Understand distribution of features (Age, Income, Spending Score) via histograms, violin plots, box plots, etc.

ii) Customer Segmentation

a) K-Means Clustering

b) Hierarchical Clustering

c) PCA for dimensionality reduction & visualization

iii) Supervised Learning

a) Decision Tree Classifier

b) Random Forest Classifier

iv) Gender-based Analysis

a) Comparison of Age, Income, and Spending Score between males and females

b) Visualizations (boxplots, violin plots, etc.)

**📊 Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Scipy

Plotly (optional for interactive plots)

**🔍 Key Visualizations**
Gender Distribution (Pie & Bar Chart)

Age, Income, and Spending Score Distributions (Histogram, KDE)

Violin Plots (Age, Income, Spending Score by Gender & Cluster)

Correlation Matrix

Cluster Visualizations (2D & 3D with PCA)

🧠 Algorithms Used
K-Means Clustering: To segment customers based on features

Hierarchical Clustering: To visualize tree-based grouping

PCA: For visualizing customer segments in lower dimensions

Decision Trees & Random Forests: To classify customers into segments

📈 Results
Identified clear customer segments based on spending patterns and income.

Visualized differences in spending behavior across gender and age groups.

Achieved high accuracy in classification tasks using Random Forests.
